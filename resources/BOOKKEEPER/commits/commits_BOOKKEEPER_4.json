IndexPersistenceMgr\n\nThere is a number of bugs in index persistence mgr related to how\nrefcounts are handled and how FileInfos are freed, due to the locking\nmechanism. These can result in the fencing bit being lost in ledgers,\nwhich is a serious issue. They also cause flakes in\nIndexPersistenceMgrTest#testEvictFileInfoWhenUnderlyingFileExists.\n\nFor details see the discussion at:\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/513/files/8075b0#r156676238\n\nThere are two key problems.\n\n1. FileInfos are flushed asynchronously on eviction. If another thread\ntries to read the FileInfo after the flush has been scheduled, but\nbefore it runs, it will read stale date (and we'll possibly lose the\nfence bit).\n2. FileInfos can be closed while it is still references in the\nIndexPersistenceMgr. This means that it can be fenced, but this will\nvery be flushed to disk because the FileInfo is already closed.\n\nThe patch solves this by moving FileInfo locking and refcount into a\nseparate class, FileInfoBackingCache. When either the write cache or\nread cache load a file info, it tries to load it from this backing\ncache. All writes to the the backing cache are done under a write\nlock. This class also takes care of reference counting. It hands out\nCachedFileInfo objects, which will be flushed to disk when all\nreferences are released.\n\nAuthor: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Yiming Zang <yzang2016@gmail.com>, Sijie

jar\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n**Problem:**\n\n`shadedArtifactAttached` was introduced in 4.6.0 to generate plain and shaded artifact for `bookkeeper-server`. Because for projects (e.g. distributedlog) that would use same protobuf and guava version as bookkeeper, they will use the plain artifact (to avoid shading protobuf/guava multiple times). However there are a few problems with that:\n\n1) bookkeeper-common is not included in the shading include set.\n2) `shadedArtifactAttached` only generate a shaded artifact (with relocated classes), but doesn't generate a dependency-reduced pom file. so you have to manually exclude relocated dependencies.\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n- for shaded artifact of `bookkeeper-server`, include all the bookkeeper submodules that bookkeeper-server depends on. so the shaded artifact includes all the classes that need to be relocated.\n- introduce a `shaded` module for keeping new shaded libraries. Currently `bookkeeper-server-shaded` is a shaded module of `bookkeeper-server`, while `bookkeeper-server-tests-shaded` is a shaded moulde of the tests jar of `bookkeeper-server`.\n- update the client api documentation about the instructions on how to use shaded artifact of `bookkeeper-server` and the new shaded module `bookkeeper-server-shaded`.\n- add test cases to verify the shaded artifact and the new shaded modules generate the right artifacts.\n\n**This change doesn't address:**\n\nCurrently both client and server are bundled in one `bookkeeper-server`. this change will not introduce any shaded client-only jar. that would be deferred until we split `bookkeeper-server` module.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Jia Zhai

master key in ledger storage\n\nWhen the bookie crashes and restart, it will replay the entries from the journal. In the case of ledgers that were created, but their metadata was not flushed on disk, the ledger metadata might be lost.\n\nThis is more evident in `DbLedgerStorage`, since the ledger metadata is cached in memory and it's only inserted in the db at the checkpoint time, though it applies as well for `InterleavedLedgerStorage` where the ledger metadata was inserted in the cache but not fsynced on disk.\n\nIf the page cache content is gone, when replaying the journal content, the ledger will be tracked in memory but the bookie won't have the metadata on disk anymore.\n\nMerging from yahoo

EntryLogMetadata\n\nPorting commits https://github.com/yahoo/bookkeeper/commit/74afc16d1c1e93739edf4a78801c5ccb6afd3883 and https://github.com/yahoo/bookkeeper/commit/eba3bbfbbaf58118c0c5736b56d3897a5928bc89 from Yahoo branch.\n\nCurrently the `EntryLogger` is keeping a `ConcurrentHashMap<Long, Long>` to keep track of amount of data stored in a single entry log file for each of the ledgers.\n\nThe amount of memory required is high because of the objects boxing. The `Long` used for key and value are 16 bytes each and the hash-map node will take another ~24 bytes.\n\nAdditionally, all these objects are created, stored for hours and then GCed, after being tenured.\n\nBy using `ConcurrentLongLongHashMap`, we eliminate the object boxing and the need for the \"node\" since it's a open hashmap. This helps reducing a lot the memory used by the bookie when storing a large amount of entries (54 --> 16 bytes).\nAlso since we store the items in `long[]`, this will not need objects and it will not affect GC.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>\n\nThis closes #821 from

client\n\nPart of #230, this adds checkstyle verification to the bookie and client packages in `bookkeeper-server`.\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThe changes here are primarily cosmetic, but there are also two notable changes to point out:\n\n1. In both `TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy.TruePredicate` and `TopologyAwareEnsemblePlacementPolicy.EnsembleForReplacementWithNoConstraints` a `public static final` field was renamed from `instance` to `INSTANCE`. This is consistent with the use of an `INSTANCE` field in the `bookkeeper-stats` package. An alternative would be to introduce a public method `getInstance()`, but either way the checkstyle rules don't like a public constant field in lower case.\n\n2. In `UpdateLedgerOp#updateBookieIdInLedgers()`, the `throws BKException` part of the signature is problematic and prevents the checkstyle validation from completing successfully. From what I can tell, that checked exception is never thrown; as such, I have removed that from the signature. I have also removed the corresponding guard from `bookie.BookieShell`.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Coburn <acoburn@amherst.edu>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli <eolivelli@gmail.com>, Sijie Guo
