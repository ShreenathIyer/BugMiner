RO when diskfull\n\nWhen the disk is above threshold, Bookie goes to RO. If we have to restart the\nbookie, on the way back, bookie tries to create new entrylog and other files,\nwhich will fail because disk usage is above threshold,\nhence bookie refuses to come up. So with this fix we will try to start in RO\nmode if RO is enabled.\n\nAlso, if bookie has died abruptly then it may missed flushing EntryMemtable and\nIndexInMemoryPageManager. So next time when it starts when disc is full\nit is failing to create index file and it is shutting down, though we expect it\nto start in readonlymode. So Bookie should be able to create index file\nthough it has reached the diskusagethreshold, while starting the Bookie in\nReadonly Mode. But ofcourse there should be some config to safeguard when\ndisk usable space is so low.\n\nMinor fixes in shutdown logic of Bookie and Bookieserver.\n\nAuthor: Charan Reddy Guttapalem

-0700\n\nBK LedgerMetadata: more memory-efficient parsing of configs\nLooking at the most prevalent client-side memory allocations, I noticed that we allocate 4KB every time we open a ledger. This is caused by allocating a 4KB buffer (in TextFormat.toStringBuilder) to account for the maximum possible Protobufs message, which is unnecessary in our case: we know the exact size of the metadata ( << 500 B) and don't need to allocate more.\nTextFormat.merge(Readable, Message.Builder) is the current method we use. This changes to use TextFormat.merge(CharSequence, Message.Builder), which avoids the extra 4K allocation conversion + an extra StringBuilder.\n\nRB_ID=745700\n\nAuthor: Alex Yarmula

avoid data copy\n\nTo avoid copying the entries payloads when writing/reading on a ledger and having to allocate a lot of `byte[]` on the JVM heap, we need to accept Netty ByteBuf buffer.\n\nBy passing a ByteBuf, an application can use a pooled buffer, pointing to direct memory, to the `LedgerHandle.addEntry()` and have the same buffer forwarded on the connection sockets to the bookies.\n\nThe same thing on the read side, `LedgerEntry` exposes an additional `getEntryBuffer()` method that can be used to get the underlying buffer and possibly forward that to some other connection, with zero-copy behavior (excluding getting data in-out of the kernel).\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@yahoo-inc.com>\n\nReviewers: Jia Zhai, Sijie Guo, Enrico Olivelli\n\nCloses #155 from
