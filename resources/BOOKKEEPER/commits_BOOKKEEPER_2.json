we run two installs. one is the default install by travis, the other one is install with apache-rat/spotbug checks in script section, which make the build slow.\n- travis_retry and travis_wait spread across different commands in the script section\n\n*Solution*\n\n- move build logic into a bash script file and invoke the script\n- skip install section in travis\n\n*Result*\n\nThis reduces travis build time by 10+ mins and make it stable\n\nNOTES:\n\nThe changes under `site` and `stream/distributedlog` are used `empty commits` to trigger corresponding builds in travis.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo

module\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\n*Motivation*\n\nsince 4.7, we are shipping the binary distribution using bookkeeper-dist modules. so it is making more sense to have {bin,conf} directory at root module,\nrather than bookkeeper-server module.\n\n*Solution*\n\n- move bookkeeper-server/bin to bin\n- move bookkeeper-server/conf to conf\n- update the new bookkeeper cli related files as \"experimental\"\n\nThis change is needed for integrating with dlog scripts for BP-26 and new bookkeeper cli for BP-27.\n\nMaster Issue: #1147\n\nRelated Issues:\n\n- BP-26 #1024\n- BP-27

change\n\nThis PR is a port from Yahoo branch: https://github.com/yahoo/bookkeeper/commit/dbfd2073b6e687a5b4b9c56a0f0c3436f177db58\n\nIt adds a hook so that a placement policy implementation can add a way to notify the main rackaware policy that the rack mappings were updated.\n\nThis was used to have a specialized policy that keeps the mapping (bookie -> rack) in ZooKeeper. Whenever the new bookies are added (or updated), the administrator would update the mapping and we need to start using the new settings.\n\nAuthor: Matteo Merli <mmerli@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Sijie

What's been making it harder to figure out was that the issue was only reproducing on Jenkins, not locally, and the lack of thread dumps along with Surefire failing to produce reports for these tests, making them next to invisible in Jenkins output.\n\n**Related**\n\nIssue #463 / PR #481 changes help terminate tests hanging in `Before` or `After` by changing `Test` based \"local\" timeouts to

MavenClassLoader\n\nTo properly test some functionality we need to be able to call static\nmethods (e.g. for the creation of ByteBuf), and also to be able to\nbuild callbacks (e.g. to call async methods).\n\nThis patch implements methods for doing this. For static methods, you\nneed to pass the className, the method name and a list of\narguments. It first tries to find the method using non-primitive\ntypes, but falls back to trying primative types if possible.\n\nInvokation looks like:\n```\ncl.callStaticMethod(\"org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BKException\",\n                    \"create\", [-101])\n```\n\nFor callbacks you specify an interface and the a groovy closure.\nIt is assumed the closure will take as many arguments as the\ncallback. The invokation handler doesn't check the method name\ncalled on the callback object, so it only works with callbacks\nwith a single method.\n\nInvokation looks like:\n```\ndef callback = classLoader.createCallback(\n    \"org.apache.bookkeeper.client.AsyncCallback\\$AddCallback\",\n        { rc, _ledger, entryId, ctx ->\n            // do something\n        })\n```\n\nAuthor: Ivan
