the changes in this PR:\n\nThis change is mainly to remove `zookeeper` reference from metadata interface. The existence of `Optional<ZooKeeper>` is to allow passing an external zookeeper client to bookkeeper, so bookkeeper can reuse that client instance. That is useful for services like pulsar broker, which they can only instantiate a zookeeper client and pass the zookeeper client around to construct bookkeeper client. However, this pollutes the registration client interface, change the method to `Optional<Object>` as an optional context object and let the implementation interpret it.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo

NoSuchEntry on wQ-aQ+1 errors\n\nIn the case of a recovery read, we rely on a NoSuchEntry response on the\nfirst missing entry to determine the final LAC.  As such, we need to\nconsider an entry to be gone once we see wQ-aQ+1 NoSuchEntry/Ledger\nresponses from bookies.  Otherwise, a zombie bookie can prevent ledger\nrecovery from suceeding indefinitely (it'll hit the timeout each time).\n\nThere was some preexisting logic from\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BOOKKEEPER-365\nb6c1a8bbd7c2d44c2edb59d9938fa073f6f478de,\nbut it seems to have been too conservative in that it waited for all\nresponses and required that there were no other errors present.  It\nseems now to be unnecessary, and so has been removed.\n\nTestParallelRead.testFailParallelReadMissingEntryImmediately seemed to\nrely on the previous logic working outside of recovery, but I believe it\nwas really meant to test the recovery case, so it has been adjusted.\n\n(bug W-4651456)\nSigned-off-by: Samuel Just <sjustsalesforce.com>\n\nAuthor: Samuel Just

in this PR:\n\n`BookieShell` is the current bookkeeper cli for interacting and operating a bookkeeper cluster. However, this class is getting bigger with more commands added to it. It is facing a few problems for maintenance and extensibility.\n\n- All commands sit in one gaint shell class. It is hard to tell if a command is used for managing a bookie only or if a command is used for managing a cluster.\n- Lack of unit tests. This class has very few test coverage. Most of the commands (introduced in early days) don't have a unit test.\n- Lack of extensibility. If a new function component (for example, dlog) is introduced, it is a bit hard to extend this CLI to have commands for new function component.\n\nAll these problems lead to the proposal here. This proposal is to propose refactoring/redesigning the bookkeeper CLI to allow better managebility for maintenance, better test coverage and better extensibility for new function components.\n\nMaster Issue: #1000\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly <ivank@apache.org>, Jia Zhai <None>\n\nThis closes #1093 from
