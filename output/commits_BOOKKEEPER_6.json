for managing components in bookie server\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThe motivation of creating lifecycle components is described in #508.\n\nThis changes include:\n\n- create bookkeeper-common module, move some common classes (such as interface annotations) to common module.\n- add the lifecycle components in bookkeeper-common module.\n- add a package `org.apache.bookkeeper.server` for keeping all server related classes.\n- rewrite BookieServer using the lifecycle components: stats provider | bookie server | auto recovery | http endpoint\n- BookieServer is still kept for backward compatible, all the main functions are delegated to `org.apache.bookkeeper.server.Main`.\n\nAuthor: Jia Zhai <zhaijia@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Enrico Olivelli
