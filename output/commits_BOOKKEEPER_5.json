However, as with #792, there is a constant field whose name needed to be renamed. `AbstractConfiguration` has a `protected static final` field called `defaultLoader`. This field is used in the two implementing classes, so keeping `protected` visibility seems right. So in this case, the field has been renamed to `DEFAULT_LOADER` while keeping the `protected static final` modifiers.\n\nThe changed line is:

indefinitely\n\nIntegrating some changes made to Yahoo bookkeeper by Matteo Merli.\n\nThe apache bookkeeper thread pool in use by OrderedScheduler is different, and does not have access to setting a queue size limit, so I created QueueAssessibleExecutorService, and check the queue size instead.  Other than that, this code change is pretty similar to Yahoo's.\n\nOriginal bug description for this change:\n\nSince we are using a thread pool to handle read requests in bookies, we have seen that when the Bookie read IO is maxed out, the requests are being accumulated in the bookie.\n\nEssentially, the bookie is busy serving read requests that have already been timed out on the client side (end to end read latency can reach hours..). The queue keeps growing indefinitely, leading to OOM errors and bookie restart.\n\nAll unit tests pass for me locally with this change.\n\nAuthor: Aaron Gresch <agresch@yahoo-inc.com>\n\nReviewers:

add transaction support\n\nProblem:\nCompaction might keep generating duplicated data which would cause disk full.\nThis is because we don't have transactional operation for compaction. So if compaction\nkeeps failing in the middle, bookie would end up with a lot of garbage data.\n\nChange:\n1. Introduce abstract class AbstractLogCompactor with an interface compact().\n2. Move the existing compaction logic to a separate class called EntryLogCompactor.\n3. Introduce transactional compaction, we can recover an incomplete compaction or rollback a compaction failure.\n4. Add an configuration to enable transactional compaction\n\nPotential Risk:\n1. No risk if we keep using the default compactor.\n2. If we choose to enable transactional compaction with separate log file, we need to be careful about it, since we use a separate log for compaction, if we have a lot of old small ledgers in the bookie, we will end up with a lot of small entry log files. And this will potentially cause bookkeeper \"Too many open files\" because GC will scan all the entry log files and keep them open.\n\nAuthor: Yiming Zang <yzang@twitter.com>\n\nReviewers: Enrico

ensemble placement policy\n\nDescriptions of the changes in this PR:\n\nThis pull request ports the changes from [twitter/bookkeeperfc7e171](https://github.com/twitter/bookkeeper/commit/fc7e171135a58cddb9e91f5f614b3ceb6f9f9fee)\n\nThe changes include:\n\n1. when bookkeeper admin re-replicates a ledger, it will pick a bookie from the available bookies in the cluster to satisfy the placement constraint. (#596)\n2. hence, remove `targetBookie` from ReplicationWorker, because the parameter will volatile the placement constraint. (#583)\n3. at the same time, change `LedgerFragement` to represent the number of bookies that need to be check and replicate. a) the ledger checker can use the correct bookie index for verifying the existence of entries in a bookie (for stripping case) b) only read entries one time when need to replicate them to multiple bookies.\n\nAuthor: Sijie Guo <sijie@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Ivan Kelly
